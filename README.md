# Low-Budget-Motion-Capture-System-Like-a-VICON-System

This repo provides user to setup low-budget system which is ingeniously designed to deliver results comparable to those achieved by high-end motion capture systems like VICON. Leveraging advanced algorithms and sensor technologies, our solution provides precise and accurate motion tracking capabilities at a fraction of the cost. This Project carried out @cranfield Universisty indoor autonomous lab.

## Step: 1 - Software Requirements
--> Install Python for preprocessing and Matlab & Simulink 2020b or higher version for post processing.

--> Clone the repo in your local directory.  
--> Install the pre-requisites
```
pip3 install cv2 math numpy matplotlib.pyplot
```

## Step: 2 - Hardware Requirement
--> ELP or any USB camera with brightness adjustment.

--> Central Processing system (Laptop or PC).  
--> LEDs (Red or Green)

## Step: 3- Arrangement
--> Added The LED on object you want to track.
